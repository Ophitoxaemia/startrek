Star Trek Reimagined 

STR uses similar controls and game play as the classic Super Star Trek, however, it is updated to include foes and features from later series. 
It was written on a Clockwork PicoCalc using the default PicoMite implementation of MMBASIC.

Getting started 
1. Load the game into program memory
2. Press F2 to run the game
3. Enter 'c' at the "Command?" prompt to see list of commands. You command the ship using these options.

The goal

You win the game by destroying every Klingon. You lose if the Enterprise is destroyed, runs out of power, or you run out of time. 

Game area

There is an 8 by 8 grid of quadrants, and each quadrant is further divided into an 8 by 8 grid which can contain ships, bases, and stars. 

Moving the ship

You use warp power to move between quadrants and impulse power to move within a quadrant. You will be prompted for a direction and the power to use. Power 3 with warp drive, for example, moves the ship a distance of 3 quadrants. 

Scanning within a quadrant

You use the short range scanners to display a grid of what and where objects are around the Enterprise.

Scanning nearby quadrants 

Long range scanners show info on the 8 quadrants adjacent to the one you are currently in.

Each quadrant is depicted by three single digit numbers. The first number is the number of stars, the second is the number of bases and the third is the number of Klingons.

Combat

If you enter a quadrant with one or more Klingon ships, your status will change to Red Alert. You can fire phasers or launch a photon torpedo.
But first, you should Raise Shields by transferring power from the main reserve to the shields.

For phasers, you specify the power to use, which automatically targets all the Klingon ships, dividing your entered power equally among the Klingon ships. 
Any Klingons not destroyed will return fire, damaging your shields.

If your shields drop to zero, the Klingon phasers will damage systems on the Enterprise. 

You can view which systems are damaged and how long they will take to repair using the Damage Report" command. In some cases you will need to dock at a base for repair (see below about bases.)

Photon torpedos need to be aimed, but they destroy the enemy vessel 100% of the time when they hit. 

Bases

You can resupply and repair the Enterprise by docking at a base. To do so, use impulse power to move the Enterprise next to the base. 

The Borg

There is one Borg cube in the galaxy, entering its quadrant sets off a series of events. First, the Borg will scan the Enterprise. If you do not leave the quadrant immediately, the Borg ship will attack the Enterprise. If you warp out of the quadrant, the Borg ship starts methodically moving from quadrant to quadrant, destroying any bases it finds. 

Stardate

You have a limited amount of time to complete the mission, the mission end stardate is shown in the short range scanner's output. You lose when time runs out.
